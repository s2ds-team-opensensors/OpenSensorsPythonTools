# S2DS Virtual 2015 - Team Opensensors

## Introduction

This repository contains code and tools for the analysis of [Opensensors](https://www.opensensors.io/) data that were created as part of the 5 week [S2DS](http://www.s2ds.org/) program.

## Getting the data

[OpenSensorsAPI.py](https://github.com/s2ds-team-opensensors/OpenSensorsPythonTools/blob/master/OpenSensorsAPI.py) - Contains tools for accessing OpenSensors historic API

[OpenSensorsData.py](https://github.com/s2ds-team-opensensors/OpenSensorsPythonTools/blob/master/OpenSensorsData.py) - Contains tools to extract the data from OpenSensors API and save as csv files

## Analysing the data

[OpenSensorsAnalyse.py](https://github.com/s2ds-team-opensensors/OpenSensorsPythonTools/blob/master/OpenSensorsAnalyse.py) - Contains tools for analysing OpenSensors data (csv files)

## Plotting the data

[OpenSensorsPlot.py](https://github.com/s2ds-team-opensensors/OpenSensorsPythonTools/blob/master/OpenSensorsPlot.py) - Contains tools for plotting OpenSensors data (csv files)

## Running the code

[OpenSensorsRun.py](https://github.com/s2ds-team-opensensors/OpenSensorsPythonTools/blob/master/OpenSensorsRun.py) - Main file for running OpenSensors Python Tools
